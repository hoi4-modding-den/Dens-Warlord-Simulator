 XIS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Hui Islamic Republic is a state born out of necessity as opposed to nationalism. After Gansu fell in to the hands of the Communist forces, causing the effective collapse of the authority of the three Ma families, it became evident that some sort of an administrative body should be formed to defend the rights of the Hui Muslim community. Thus the Republic was conceived, headed by no other than Hu Songshan, an important figure amongst the Chinese Muslim community. Hu believes in the collective strength of the Chinese peoples, though only time will tell if the enosis between the Islamic Republic and the KMT government will ever become a possibility."
