 XKM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Located in northern Xinjiang, the Kumul Khanate has a unique ethnic mix of Turkic, Mongol, Han, and Uyghur populations. The pivotal role of General Yulbars Khan, who leveraged the East Turkestan movements to establish a pro-Kumuntang state in northwestern China, significantly shaped the course of the Kumul Khanate's history. The nation is currently grappling with the challenge of quelling the nationalistic Uyghur population, which vehemently opposes unification with China. The added complexity of Communist infiltration further worsens the nation's struggle to define its identity amidst the looming prospect of Chinese integration."
