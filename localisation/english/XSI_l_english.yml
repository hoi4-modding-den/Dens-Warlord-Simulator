 XSI_foreigner_republic_desc:0 "While technically a democracy, voting is limited solely to foreign landowners, a fraction of a fraction of the city's population, of which only about a quarter of that actually votes in elections. In practice, Shanghai is run by a thousand wealthy citizens in a manner more reminiscent of a corporation than an actual city. While this helps us expedite political decisions, the decisions we do make have little regard for the actual desires of the majority working class Chinese population."

Since the ceasefire in May 1931, Japanese police forces have effectively occupied the neighborhood of Hongkew, with our government having no control over the neighborhood. Fears of Japanese political subversion, if not another military invasion, cannot be alleviated until the district is returned to our control."

In practice, the Great Way government is nothing more than a crime syndicate in municipal clothing, embezzling funds while trafficking narcotics, to say nothing of the Japanese military’s harsh measures used to maintain control." 
 XSI_broke:0 "Running on Fiscal Fumes"
 XSI_broke_desc:0 "Despite the council's efforts to maintain fiscal stability, we are deep in the red, due in part to the reconstruction of the city, and the expansion of our police forces. While we have managed to maintain our budget due to our reserve funds from the sale of electricity, our reserves are quickly diminishing. We must either raise our taxes in an efficient manner, or 'cut out the fat', if we even have enough fat left to cut."
 XSI_safe_place:0 "Refuge of the World"
 XSI_safe_place_desc:0 "Due to the city government's loosely-defined semi-legal existence, we have little to no restrictions on immigration. As a result, many refugees have migrated to the city, either to get away from the chaos that has engulfed the rest of China, or to escape persecution from places like Germany. If the city finds itself occupied, the refugees will likely be forced to flee."

 XSI_white_terror_desc:0 "On April 12th, 1927, conservative KMT forces, cooperating with the Green Gang crime syndicate, started a brutal purge against the CPC, Left-KMT, and other progressive forces in China, starting with Shanghai. In what came to be known as the April 12 Massacre, over 5,000-10,000 people, suspected communists, communist sympathizers, union members, and non-traditionally dressed women, were executed by the army in the streets. While the purge effectively destroyed any overt communist influence in Shanghai, it has extensively radicalized those who had survived, and scared off many people from the KMT."

 XSI.NE_1.t:0 "The Situation in Shanghai, 1936"
 XSI.NE_1.d:0 "The Shanghai International Settlement was founded in 1863 from the merger of the American and British concessions that were established in the aftermath of the First Opium War. Unlike Macau and Hong Kong, the Shanghai concessions were legally under Chinese sovereignty, but the city government is managed by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC). The SMC was created and managed with the support of all treaty powers, which was expanded to include 18 different nations by 1914, but the city is mostly managed by the British and the Americans.\n\nHowever, with the Xinhai Revolution and the start of the warlord era, there has not been any single unified Chinese government to answer to, leaving Shanghai de facto independent. The civil war between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Socialist forces has left China divided, chaotic, and vulnerable to Japanese aggression. Anti-Communist forces carried out a purge of suspected socialists in 1927, killing tens of thousands, while Japanese forces staged an anti-Japanese riot in 1932, resulting in the Japanese military razing the city, permanently occupying the neighborhood of Hongkew, and forcing the KMT military to leave the city.\n\nAfter the Japanese invasion, with pressure from the British, the KMT was forced to surrender the Chinese portions of Shanghai, while the French concession was also annexed into the International Settlement. While this expansion has granted us more resources to repair the city, it has also strained our budget, and greatly increased the tensions between our foreigner-led Council and the local Chinese population. If the Pearl of the Orient is to survive the decade, we must take decisive action, before the Japanese do it for us."
 XSI.NE_1.a:0 "The sparrow may be small, but all the vital organs are there, hopefully..."
 XSI.NE_2.t:0 "The End of the Settlement"
 XSI.NE_2.d:0 "It is over. Our worst fears have come to fruition. The international settlement is officially and completely bankrupt. Chaos has engulfed Shanghai as the unpaid police forces have turned their backs on the city. In a final meeting of the municipal council, the council discussed the possibility of officially returning the city to the Chinese government, or at the very least, whichever government is capable of governing us. The Japanese members of the council have discussed the possibility of ‘gifting’ the territory to Japan as ‘a gesture of good will’, though this may not be the best solution, even with the civil war in China still ongoing."
 XSI.NE_2.a:0 "Return Shanghai to the Nationalist Government"
 XSI.NE_2.b:0 "Return Shanghai to the Beiyang Government"

 XSI.NE_2.f:0 "Whoever neighbors us is fine"
 XSI.NE_3.t:0 "Shanghai granted to us"
 XSI.NE_3.d:0 "It seems that the Shanghai government has completely collapsed, as the municipal government there has found itself completely insolvent. As part of their insolvency, they have sold most of their assets, but have granted the actual territory of Shanghai to us. It will take us a bit to pay off the city debts, but otherwise we have effectively been given free land."
 XSI.NE_3.a:0 "Who are we to look a gift horse in the mouth?"
 XSI.NE_4.t:0 "End of the Refuge"
 XSI.NE_4.d:0 "Prior to the Japanese takeover, Shanghai effectively had no restrictions on immigration, allowing anyone to move here, provided that they could get out of their home country. However, this has changed, as the Japanese government, seeking to legitimize the country and seek favor with other fascist nations, has implemented immigration restrictions on us. While the people who moved here can stay, this puts an end to our status as a ‘safe-haven’, and paves the path forward for increased discrimination at a later date."

 XSI.FE_1.t:0 "Replacing Chén Jiè"
 XSI.FE_1.d:0 "Born in Hangzhou in 1885 to a well-off family, Chén Jiè studied in Japan after the Qing abolished the examination system, before transferring to the University of Berlin to study law in 1907, returning to China after the Xinhai Revolution. A lifelong bureaucrat, Chén Jiè had previously served in several directorial and administrative roles in the Bayang government while concurrently as a professor at Peking University. But since 1928, he has left government work and has worked mostly as the head manager of several banks, notably the Salt Industry Bank which was relocated to Shanghai in 1934. Having moved to Shanghai, he was appointed to the ratepayer council, having served as one of the main representatives for Chinese business on the council. However, the Kuomintang government reached out to Chén Jiè in 1935, seeking to appoint him as secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a result of his connections with Germany. In a meeting on December 23rd, Chén Jiè had submitted his resignation from the council, effective January 4th, and suggested that the Chinese members of the council should discuss a replacement to fill his vacancy.\n\nOn December 27th, members of the Chinese Ratepayers Association publicly ‘‘elected’’ Xi Yushu, a native of Shanghai and manager of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, but this election has been called into question. Because Chén Jiè did not finish his term, his replacement is supposed to be elected with majority approval from the council, not just the Chinese representatives. While this has occurred once before without issue, it is still against council rules, and several council members have questioned if filling the vacancy is necessary this close to the yearly elections making Xi’s reelection an inevitability, not to mention the possibility of this inspiring other council members to act with greater impunity (particularly the Japanese members). Despite this, Xi Yushu’s appointment by the majority of the council would be greatly appreciated by the Chinese members of the council, and the election of a local (even a bourgeois one) would help with convincing the local population of our legitimacy."
 XSI.FE_1.a:0 "Approve Xi Yushu’s ascension to the Council"
 XSI.FE_1.b:0 "Reject the Chinese Ratepayers election as illegal"
 XSI.FE_2.t:0 "Japanese push for increased representation"
 XSI.FE_2.d:0 "In a reaction to our perceived preference for the Chinese council members, the Japanese electorate of Shanghai have petitioned our government for greater representation. While the question of increased representation was brought up prior to the 1935 elections, it was quickly dropped, and the election proceeded without incident. While increased representation would help with appeasing the Japanese presence in our city (both electoral and military), expanding the number of seats would require the approval of all members of the council, and would certainly be rejected by the Chinese members. Recognizing this, the Japanese electorate has decided to push for three candidates to the council, hoping to replace one of the British or American members. The British and American electorate who make up the majority of our voting base have perceived this as an aggressive move against their interests, and would likely retaliate if we don’t step in. However, with tensions high between the Chinese and Japanese governments, it might be in our best interests to appease the Japanese if possible."
 XSI.FE_2.a:0 "It is not in our jurisdiction to interfere in elections"
 XSI.FE_2.b:0 "Expressly forbid any greater Japanese representation"
 XSI.FE_3.t:0 "Anglo-American Associations campaign against Japanese Candidates"
 XSI.FE_3.d:0 "Ever since the incorporation of the French concession, there have been 16 members of the municipal council. 2 seats are elected by the French electorate, 9 seats are elected by the remaining foreign electorate, and the 5 remaining seats are elected solely by the Chinese electorate. While all 9 of the foreign seats could be elected as British due to a larger electorate, an unofficial agreement with the Residents’ Associations ensures that a 5-2-2 split is maintained. But as a result of the three Japanese members running for the foreign council positions, the British Residents’ Association has urged foreign voters to vote exclusively for 7 non-Japanese foreign candidates in the upcoming municipal election. While the election system is ranked choice, with foreign voters allowed to vote for 9 candidates numbered from 1 to 9, voters are allowed to vote for less than 9 candidates. With the larger non-Japanese electorate, this would effectively shut out the Japanese from electing a third member to the council if successful, nullifying their efforts." 
 XSI.FE_3.a:0 "They should be glad they still have seats on the council"
 XSI.FE_4.t:0 "The 1936 Municipal Election"
 XSI.FE_4.d:0 "The results of the Shanghai Municipal Elections have been collated, and the results are as expected. The five British and two American candidates have secured their positions on the council, while the Japanese remain with two seats. However, even with Anglo-American cooperation, the numbers for the Japanese electorate were lower than expected. After some searching, 323 Japanese ballots were found to have simply not been counted during the counting process. The election workers claim that the Japanese ballots were inadvertently missed in the counting process. Whether or not this is true is not important to us, but we should be careful with how to approach the situation."
 XSI.FE_4.a:0 "Call for re-elections a month from now"
 XSI.FE_4.b:0 "It's not significant enough to affect the results"
 XSI.FE_5.t:0 "Third Japanese candidate drops out of election"
 XSI.FE_5.d:0 "While starting up preparations for the April re-election, the Japanese Election Committee has approached us, stating that they intend to only run two candidates for the upcoming re-election. The leading Japanese candidate, Toshi Go, assistant manager of the Shanghai office for The South Manchuria Railway Company (or Mantetsu), has elected to give his place to incumbent candidate Takue Urabe, reducing the running Japanese candidates to two. The Japanese Committee has stated that they dropped the issue due to a desire to prevent ‘‘unnecessary excitement’’ within the international community, but that they intend to press the issue again at an unknown later date.\n\nFrom the municipal council’s point of view, this has solved two birds with one stone. With the Japanese Representation issue temporarily resolved, and the number of candidates running now equaling the 9 seats available, the Land Regulation laws state that candidates can simply be directly appointed to the council without the need for a full re-election. With the council now stable, at least for another year, we can be confident in affirming British supremacy in the council indefinitely."
 XSI.FE_5.a:0 "What a waste of time to end up back at the status quo"
 XSI.FE_6.t:0 "Japanese citizens demand re-election"
 XSI.FE_6.d:0 "Japanese residents of Shanghai have brought a storm of protests against us in retaliation for ignoring their ballots. Japanese businesses have started to turn away tax collectors, while angry letters fill our mailbox. The incumbent members of our council have demanded that we avoid angering the wealthy Japanese electorate any further, and call for re-elections. While it was not stated in the meeting, memories of the January 28 incident are fresh in Shanghai’s mind. If we don’t take action now, someone else might do it for us."
 XSI.FE_6.a:0 "Better late than never"
 XSI.FE_6.b:0 "We will not tolerate this shameless power grab"
 XSI.FE_7.t:0 "The Empire of Japan ‘‘requests’’ greater representation in the Muncipal Council"
 XSI.FE_7.d:0 "In a barely concealed threat against our sovereignty, the Japanese government has publicly stated that our government has taken on an overtly anti-Japanese stance. In an effort to counter anti-Japanese bias, the Empire has requested that we expand the total number of dedicated foreign-held seats on our council to 12, with the expectation that the 3 new seats will be granted to Japanese candidates, putting them on par with the British in terms of council representation. While this wouldn’t give them control over Shanghai directly, as the Japanese are still outnumbered by the other members, it would greatly expand the Japanese influence in Shanghai as a whole. The Japanese demands are not just bluffs, as the Japanese cruiser Izumo has been re-dispatched to Shanghai in order to ‘‘ensure stability’’, and is currently stationed in the Huangpu River, half a kilometer from our office, as it did 4 years prior, when half the city was burned."

The five British and two American candidates have secured their positions on the council, while the Japanese have gained the three new seats on the council, resulting in the Japanese having five total seats. British newspapers have already published that the election has been stolen by Japanese subterfuge, and while the Anglophone nationals living in Shanghai have vocally expressed their displeasure with the situation, there is not much that can be done. On the bright side, the council is still technically in British hands, though one has to wonder if this has appeased the Japanese, or only fueled their appetite for more..."

 XSI.FE_9.d:0 "The Bund, the neighborhood of central Shanghai just north of the old walled city, and the home of our administration, has come under siege from the Japanese garrison from the Hongkew neighborhood. Composed mostly of the local Japanese police forces that were protecting the neighborhood of Hongkew, it seems that the Japanese expected to meet little resistance in their attempted takeover. Instead, the Shanghai police have erected barricades on the streets of The Bund, instructed to drum up international support for Shanghai in the outbreak of a mass-casualty event, by putting up as much resistance as possible. While our forces are comparatively under-equipped, the Japanese were caught off-guard by this resistance, and have struggled to advance without drawing fire. The fate of Shanghai will be decided by whoever takes the first shot..."

After the conflict, large crowds of Chinese citizens formed in the Hongkew neighborhood, seeking to end the foreign occupation. Unwilling to provoke another international incident, the Japanese have completely evacuated from the neighborhood, restoring it to our control. While a victory for our forces, the Japanese government has already released a statement on the skirmish, publicly denouncing the ‘‘violent British and Chinese aggression’’ against Japanese citizens, and has demanded that the British compensate Japan for their losses. Naturally, the British have requested that this comes out of our pockets."

With the Shanghai Police forces completely disoriented, the Japanese forces faced little resistance in marching in and taking over the Consular offices. With the center of the city occupied, and the police force scattered, the British and Americans councilors have agreed to surrender. Already, the international reaction has been immediate outrage at Japan, with the British and Americans declaring an Embargo against Japan for violating Shanghai sovereignty.\n\nSeeking to avoid granting the Kwantung Army control over the territory (as had occurred in Manchuria), the Japanese forces have elected to install a collaborationist government in charge of Shanghai. After some searching, local religious professor Su Xiwen was recommended to serve as chairman of the new government. Su, a reactionary believer of Buddist-Taoist syncretism, has already made promises to both revitalize Shanghai with new public works, and to fully purge the city of KMT and CPC elements. Time will tell if these promises are kept, but for now, Shanghai is now under Japanese control."

 XSI.FE_12.d:0 "The results of the Shanghai Municipal Elections have been collated, and the results are unexpected. While the two original American candidates have secured their positions on the council, the Japanese have lost their two seats, as the candidates running have since left the city. Additionally, chairman H. E. Arnhold has resigned from the council, citing the failures of the council to de-escalate the Japan situation. As a result, American council member and former judge Cornell S. Franklin has offered to be elected chairman of the council, stating a desire to keep Shanghai at peace and profitable once more. The remaining members of the council have unanimously accepted Franklin’s promotion to Chairman and appointed his replacement members to the council, who are notably also American lawyers."

 XSI.FE_13.d:0 "With everything said and done, the situation in Shanghai is more precarious now than it has ever been. The Japanese council members have been forced to flee, bodies now line the streets, and we are even closer to insolvency than ever before. In light of this, chairman Harry Edward Arnhold has elected to resign his post from the municipal council, effective immediately. As a result, American council member and former judge Cornell S. Franklin has elected to take over the role of chairman of the council, stating a desire to keep Shanghai at peace and profitable once more. The remaining members of the council have unanimously accepted Franklin’s promotion to Chairman and his selection of new members to replace the gaps in the council, who are notably also American lawyers."

 XSI.FE_14.d:0 "Despite the questionable legality of the Chinese council members appointing a replacement of their own, our action to reject Xi Yushu from the council because of this has been perceived very negatively by the Chinese. They have stated that our actions are both inconsiderate to Chén Jiè’s circumstances, and completely unnecessary, as the council could have simply appointed Xi Yushu anyways. In protest, the Chinese council has walked out of the SMC offices, stating that they refuse to cooperate with an organization that has no regard for its own members. The remaining members of the council mostly agree that the foreign council has overstepped their bounds, with the American members suggesting that new, more Chinese-favorable regulations be passed so as to avoid any situation like this from occurring again, and to win back the favor of the Chinese council. On the other hand, the Japanese members of the council have suggested that this protest is another illegal action, and that we should not tolerate anything of this nature."

 XSI.FE_15.d:0 "At the most recent meeting of the council, the Land Regulation laws have been amended, to clearly state that the Chinese council members are now allowed to elect a replacement if one of their members retires before completing his term, in addition to issuing a formal apology to the five Chinese council members, with a vague promise to reform the council at an unknown later date to protect East Asian business interests. This seems to have worked, as the Chinese members have returned to the local office, and have agreed to make amends with the council. Perhaps more unexpectedly, chairman of the council Harry Edward Arnhold has elected to not seek re-election for the 1936 municipal elections, stating that the failures of the council to communicate lie on his shoulders, and that he is to take responsibility for the misunderstanding. In his place, American council member Cornell S. Franklin has elected to pursue the chairman position, promising to reform the municipality and to ensure peace in our time."

All expected seats have been filled as expected, with 4 British members, 2 American members, and 2 Japanese members, with the only major change being the appointment of Cornell S. Franklin as chairman of the council, while H. E. Arnhold resigns from the council, citing his unpopularity within the council. While finishing off the meeting, a replacement was determined to fill Arnhold’s seat, with Franklin nominating an associated American lawyer, giving the Americans a greater edge in the council. While a majority of seats are not technically American, Franklin’s position as chairman means that he will have little issue passing any forms and bills that he and other Americans want to push."

 XSI.FE_17.t:0 "Chinese citizens protest our government"
 XSI.FE_17.d:0 "While we expected some pushback from suspending the Chinese members of the council, we did not expect them to bring in the people. Propaganda has been distributed throughout Shanghai, accusing the municipal government of attempting to turn Shanghai into a European-settler state, with the end goal of expelling the Chinese population. While this is obviously a lie against us, the local population does not see it so, and has started protesting outside our offices. Members of our council have pointed out the similarities to the May 30th movement, in 1925, when the death of Sun Yat-Sen led to a series of strikes, ultimately leading to a series of shootings and a declaration of martial law in Shanghai. While we were able to handle it at the time by mobilizing the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the Great Depression has left us with little funding available to maintain our armed forces, and with the cooperation of the Chinese bourgeoisie and proletariat against us, we might have no choice but to accept demands for reform."

 XSI.FE_18.d:0 "As of [GetDateText], nearly every Chinese business and factory has declared a general strike against us. No longer satisfied with reforms, the demand is simple: dissolve the International Settlement. Again, normally this would be something we could deal with, but the economic situation here, and the political situation in China, means that we are out of options. By all accounts, we must accept these demands, or we will be destroyed.\n\nThere may be a way out. The Japanese members of the council have made contact with Japan and, fearing for their safety, have requested that the Japanese send reinforcements, or at least a way out of Shanghai safely. IJN cruiser Izumo is on their way, and with the Japanese police garrison in the neighborhood of Hongkew... perhaps it would be in our best interests to surrender ourselves to the devil we know..."

Japanese forces marched into the city center, dispersing crowds and firing on civilians. The crowds were larger than expected, but could not stand up to the bombardment of artillery. After several hours of what can only be described as a massacre, the general strike has been crushed. While it will take some time to fully raid any remaining hideouts, the situation has been stabilized, at the cost of a lot of blood.\n\nAlready, the Japanese have made demands for us, notably, the expansion of the council to add 8 more Japanese members, and the replacement of the chairman with a Japanese council member. While this effectively makes us a Japanese puppet state, there is nothing we can do about this. After all, we’re the ones who asked them in."

 XSI.FE_20.d:0 "Created in 1863 from the merger of the British and American concessions of Shanghai, the Shanghai International Settlement was officially dissolved as of [GetDateText]. The council has been dissolved, and its foreign members have returned to their home countries. While some Japanese forces attempted to fight against the protestors, they were outnumbered, and were forced to leave via cruiser. Shanghai is now, once again, Chinese.\n\nThe disparate groups that made up the strike have coalesced into the offices of the former municipal council. While not in agreement in nearly everything, the groups involved are simply too disorganized to strike against each other. Gradually, several parties came into being, the main one being the newly formed ‘‘China Democratic League’’ (CDL), created out of the remnants of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the Productive People's Party, and other minor left-democratic parties. On the far left, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has returned from exile, and gathered most of the Marxist-Leninists of the city. On the right-wing, the Kuomintang (KMT) have firmly established themselves as the primary opposition party of Shanghai. Lastly, the Young China Party (YCP), while very minor in support, has made itself known, primarily through its most extreme members, who have expressed a fiercely nationalist and anti-communist message. It seems that, for the time being, Shanghai may get its first taste of democracy, though it seems unlikely that the city will not inevitably face a purge in the future..."

While the government of Shanghai has struggled financially since 1929, it seems that recent efforts by the city to stabilize their situation have had the opposite effect.

In a last-minute effort to avoid further chaos, the city government has elected to annex itself into the territory of [FROM.GetNameDefCap].

The municipal government has requested that we bring them into our military alliance, so as to dissuade a Japanese invasion of the city.
