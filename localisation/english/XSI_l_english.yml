In practice, Shanghai is run by a thousand wealthy citizens in a manner more reminiscent of a corporation than an actual city.

If the city finds itself occupied, the refugees will likely be forced to flee."

In what came to be known as the April 12 Massacre, over 5,000-10,000 people, suspected communists, communist sympathizers, union members, and non-traditionally dressed women, were executed by the army in the streets. While the purge effectively destroyed any overt communist influence in Shanghai, it has extensively radicalized those who had survived, and scared off many people from the KMT."

 XSI.NE_1.t:0 "The Situation in Shanghai, 1936"
 XSI.NE_1.d:0 "The Shanghai International Settlement was founded in 1863 from the merger of the American and British concessions that were established in the aftermath of the First Opium War. Unlike Macau and Hong Kong, the Shanghai concessions were legally under Chinese sovereignty, but the city government is managed by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC). The SMC was created and managed with the support of all treaty powers, which was expanded to include 18 different nations by 1914, but the city is mostly managed by the British and the Americans.\n\nHowever, with the Xinhai Revolution and the start of the warlord era, there has not been any single unified Chinese government to answer to, leaving Shanghai de facto independent. The civil war between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Socialist forces has left China divided, chaotic, and vulnerable to Japanese aggression. Anti-Communist forces carried out a purge of suspected socialists in 1927, killing tens of thousands, while Japanese forces staged an anti-Japanese riot in 1932, resulting in the Japanese military razing the city, permanently occupying the neighborhood of Hongkew, and forcing the KMT military to leave the city.\n\nAfter the Japanese invasion, with pressure from the British, the KMT was forced to surrender the Chinese portions of Shanghai, while the French concession was also annexed into the International Settlement. While this expansion has granted us more resources to repair the city, it has also strained our budget, and greatly increased the tensions between our foreigner-led Council and the local Chinese population. If the Pearl of the Orient is to survive the decade, we must take decisive action, before the Japanese do it for us."
 XSI.NE_1.a:0 "The sparrow may be small, but all the vital organs are there, hopefully..."
 XSI.NE_2.t:0 "The End of the Settlement"
 XSI.NE_2.d:0 "It is over. Our worst fears have come to fruition. The international settlement is officially and completely bankrupt. Chaos has engulfed Shanghai as the unpaid police forces have turned their backs on the city. In a final meeting of the municipal council, the council discussed the possibility of officially returning the city to the Chinese government, or at the very least, whichever government is capable of governing us. The Japanese members of the council have discussed the possibility of ‘gifting’ the territory to Japan as ‘a gesture of good will’, though this may not be the best solution, even with the civil war in China still ongoing."

 XSI.NE_3.d:0 "It seems that the Shanghai government has completely collapsed, as the municipal government there has found itself completely insolvent. As part of their insolvency, they have sold most of their assets, but have granted the actual territory of Shanghai to us. It will take us a bit to pay off the city debts, but otherwise we have effectively been given free land."

 XSI.FE_1.t:0 "Replacing Chén Jiè"
 XSI.FE_1.d:0 "Born in Hangzhou in 1885 to a well-off family, Chén Jiè studied in Japan after the Qing abolished the examination system, before transferring to the University of Berlin to study law in 1907, returning to China after the Xinhai Revolution. A lifelong bureaucrat, Chén Jiè had previously served in several directorial and administrative roles in the Bayang government while concurrently as a professor at Peking University. But since 1928, he has left government work and has worked mostly as the head manager of several banks, notably the Salt Industry Bank which was relocated to Shanghai in 1934. Having moved to Shanghai, he was appointed to the ratepayer council, having served as one of the main representatives for Chinese business on the council. However, the Kuomintang government reached out to Chén Jiè in 1935, seeking to appoint him as secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a result of his connections with Germany. In a meeting on December 23rd, Chén Jiè had submitted his resignation from the council, effective January 4th, and suggested that the Chinese members of the council should discuss a replacement to fill his vacancy.\n\nOn December 27th, members of the Chinese Ratepayers Association publicly ‘‘elected’’ Xi Yushu, a native of Shanghai and manager of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, but this election has been called into question. Because Chén Jiè did not finish his term, his replacement is supposed to be elected with majority approval from the council, not just the Chinese representatives. While this has occurred once before without issue, it is still against council rules, and several council members have questioned if filling the vacancy is necessary this close to the yearly elections making Xi’s reelection an inevitability, not to mention the possibility of this inspiring other council members to act with greater impunity (particularly the Japanese members). Despite this, Xi Yushu’s appointment by the majority of the council would be greatly appreciated by the Chinese members of the council, and the election of a local (even a bourgeois one) would help with convincing the local population of our legitimacy."
 XSI.FE_1.a:0 "Approve Xi Yushu’s ascension to the Council"
 XSI.FE_1.b:0 "Reject the Chinese Ratepayers election as illegal"
 XSI.FE_2.t:0 "Japanese push for increased representation"
 XSI.FE_2.d:0 "In a reaction to our perceived preference for the Chinese council members, the Japanese electorate of Shanghai have petitioned our government for greater representation. While the question of increased representation was brought up prior to the 1935 elections, it was quickly dropped, and the election proceeded without incident. While increased representation would help with appeasing the Japanese presence in our city (both electoral and military), expanding the number of seats would require the approval of all members of the council, and would certainly be rejected by the Chinese members. Recognizing this, the Japanese electorate has decided to push for three candidates to the council, hoping to replace one of the British or American members. The British and American electorate who make up the majority of our voting base have perceived this as an aggressive move against their interests, and would likely retaliate if we don’t step in. However, with tensions high between the Chinese and Japanese governments, it might be in our best interests to appease the Japanese if possible."
 XSI.FE_2.a:0 "It is not in our jurisdiction to interfere in elections"
 XSI.FE_2.b:0 "We cannot afford to anger our colonial residents"
 XSI.FE_3.t:0 "Anglo-American Associations campaign against Japanese Candidates"
 XSI.FE_3.d:0 "Ever since the incorporation of the French concession, there have been 16 members of the municipal council. 2 seats are elected by the French electorate, 9 seats are elected by the remaining foreign electorate, and the 5 remaining seats are elected solely by the Chinese electorate. While all 9 of the foreign seats could be elected as British due to a larger electorate, an unofficial agreement with the Residents’ Associations ensures that a 5-2-2 split is maintained. But as a result of the three Japanese members running for the foreign council positions, the British Residents’ Association has urged foreign voters to vote exclusively for 7 non-Japanese foreign candidates in the upcoming municipal election. While the election system is ranked choice, with foreign voters allowed to vote for 9 candidates numbered from 1 to 9, voters are allowed to vote for less than 9 candidates. With the larger non-Japanese electorate, this would effectively shut out the Japanese from electing a third member to the council if successful, nullifying their efforts." 
 XSI.FE_3.a:0 "They should be glad they still have seats on the council"
 XSI.FE_4.t:0 "The 1936 Municipal Election"
 XSI.FE_4.d:0 "The results of the Shanghai Municipal Elections have been collated, and the results are as expected. The five British and two American candidates have secured their positions on the council, while the Japanese remain with two seats. However, even with Anglo-American cooperation, the numbers for the Japanese electorate were lower than expected. After some searching, 323 Japanese ballots were found to have simply not been counted during the counting process. The election workers claim that the Japanese ballots were inadvertently missed in the counting process. Whether or not this is true is not important to us, but we should be careful with how to approach the situation."
 XSI.FE_4.a:0 "Call for re-elections a month from now"
 XSI.FE_4.b:0 "It's not significant enough to affect the results"
 XSI.FE_5.t:0 "Third Japanese candidate drops out of election"
 XSI.FE_5.d:0 "While starting up preparations for the April re-election, the Japanese Election Committee has approached us, stating that they intend to only run two candidates for the upcoming re-election. The leading Japanese candidate, Toshi Go, assistant manager of the Shanghai office for The South Manchuria Railway Company (or Mantetsu), has elected to give his place to incumbent candidate Takue Urabe, reducing the running Japanese candidates to two. The Japanese Committee has stated that they dropped the issue due to a desire to prevent ‘‘unnecessary excitement’’ within the international community, but that they intend to press the issue again at an unknown later date.\n\nFrom the municipal council’s point of view, this has solved two birds with one stone. With the Japanese Representation issue temporarily resolved, and the number of candidates running now equaling the 9 seats available, the Land Regulation laws state that candidates can simply be directly appointed to the council without the need for a full re-election. With the council now stable, at least for another year, we can be confident in affirming British supremacy in the council indefinitely."
 XSI.FE_5.a:0 "What a waste of time to end up back at the status quo"
 XSI.FE_6.t:0 "Japanese citizens demand re-election"
 XSI.FE_6.d:0 "Japanese residents of Shanghai have brought a storm of protests against us in retaliation for ignoring their ballots. Japanese businesses have started to turn away tax collectors, while angry letters fill our mailbox. The incumbent members of our council have demanded that we avoid angering the wealthy Japanese electorate any further, and call for re-elections. While it was not stated in the meeting, memories of the January 28 incident are fresh in Shanghai’s mind. If we don’t take action now, someone else might do it for us."
 XSI.FE_6.a:0 "Better late than never"
 XSI.FE_6.b:0 "We will not tolerate this shameless power grab"
 XSI.FE_7.t:0 "The Empire of Japan ‘‘requests’’ greater representation in the Muncipal Council"
 XSI.FE_7.d:0 "In a barely concealed threat against our sovereignty, the Japanese government has publicly stated that our government has taken on an overtly anti-Japanese stance. In an effort to counter anti-Japanese bias, the Empire has requested that we expand the total number of dedicated foreign-held seats on our council to 12, with the expectation that the 3 new seats will be granted to Japanese candidates, putting them on par with the British in terms of council representation. While this wouldn’t give them control over Shanghai directly, as the Japanese are still outnumbered by the other members, it would greatly expand the Japanese influence in Shanghai as a whole. The Japanese demands are not just bluffs, as the Japanese cruiser Izumo has been re-dispatched to Shanghai in order to ‘‘ensure stability’’, and is currently stationed in the Huangpu River, half a kilometer from our office, as it did 4 years prior, when half the city was burned."
 XSI.FE_7.a:0 "Was the cruiser ship really necessary?"
 XSI.FE_7.b:0 "Surely they’re bluffing..."
 XSI.FE_8.t:0 "The 1936 Municipal Election"
 XSI.FE_8.d:0 "The results of the Shanghai Municipal Elections have been collated, and the results are as follows. The five British and two American candidates have secured their positions on the council, while the Japanese have gained the three new seats on the council, resulting in the Japanese having five total seats. British newspapers have already published that the election has been stolen by Japanese subterfuge, and while the Anglophone nationals living in Shanghai have vocally expressed their displeasure with the situation, there is not much that can be done. On the bright side, the council is still technically in British hands, though one has to wonder if this has appeased the Japanese, or only fueled their appetite for more..."

The municipal government has requested that we bring them into our military alliance, so as to dissuade a Japanese invasion of the city.
