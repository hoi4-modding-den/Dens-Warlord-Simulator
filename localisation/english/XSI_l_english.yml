 XSI_foreigner_republic:0 "Ratepayer Democracy"
 XSI_foreigner_republic_desc:0 "While technically a democracy, voting is limited solely to foreign landowners, a fraction of a fraction of the city's population, of which only about a quarter of that actually votes in elections. In practice, Shanghai is run by a thousand wealthy citizens in a manner more reminiscent of a corporation than an actual city. While this helps us expedite political decisions, the decisions we do make have little regard for the actual desires of the majority working class Chinese population."
 XSI_japanese_occupation_zone:0 "Japanese Occupation of Hongkew" 
 XSI_japanese_occupation_zone_desc:0 "On January 28th, 1931, Japanese forces provoked an anti-Japanese lynching, resulting in the Japanese military razing the city, with over 10,000 civilian deaths as a result. Since the ceasefire in May 1931, Japanese police forces have effectively occupied the neighborhood of Hongkew, with our government having no control over the neighborhood. Fears of Japanese political subversion, if not another military invasion, cannot be alleviated until the district is returned to our control." 
 XSI_broke:0 "Running on Fiscal Fumes"
 XSI_broke_desc:0 "Despite the council's efforts to maintain fiscal stability, we are deep in the red, due in part to the reconstruction of the city, and the expansion of our police forces. While we have managed to maintain our budget due to our reserve funds from the sale of electricity, our reserves are quickly diminishing. We must either raise our taxes in an efficient manner, or 'cut out the fat', if we even have enough fat left to cut."
 XSI_safe_place:0 "Refuge of the World"
 XSI_safe_place_desc:0 "Due to the city government's loosely-defined semi-legal existence, we have little to no restrictions on immigration. As a result, many refugees have migrated to the city, either to get away from the chaos that has engulfed the rest of China, or to escape persecution from places like Germany. If the city finds itself occupied, the refugees will likely be forced to flee."
 XSI_white_terror:0 "Memories of April 12th"
 XSI_white_terror_desc:0 "On April 12th, 1927, conservative KMT forces, cooperating with the Green Gang crime syndicate, started a brutal purge against the CPC, Left-KMT, and other progressive forces in China, starting with Shanghai. In what came to be known as the April 12 Massacre, over 5,000-10,000 people, suspected communists, communist sympathizers, union members, and non-traditionally dressed women, were executed by the army in the streets. While the purge effectively destroyed any overt communist influence in Shanghai, it has extensively radicalized those who had survived, and scared off many people from the KMT."

While normally not significant, the effective state of lawlessness in the rest of China, the endless strife in our streets, and the neverending pressure from Japan, has put our city government in a precarious situation. If we don’t acquiesce to our members' demands, we may face dire consequences..."

 XSI.NE_1.t:0 "The Situation in Shanghai, 1936"
 XSI.NE_1.d:0 "The Shanghai International Settlement was founded in 1863 from the merger of the American and British concessions that were established in the aftermath of the First Opium War. Unlike Macau and Hong Kong, the Shanghai concessions were legally under Chinese sovereignty, but the city government is managed by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC). The SMC was created and managed with the support of all treaty powers, which was expanded to include 18 different nations by 1914, but the city is mostly managed by the British and the Americans.\n\nHowever, with the Xinhai Revolution and the start of the warlord era, there has not been any single unified Chinese government to answer to, leaving Shanghai de facto independent. The civil war between the Kuomintang (KMT) and Socialist forces has left China divided, chaotic, and vulnerable to Japanese aggression. Anti-Communist forces carried out a purge of suspected socialists in 1927, killing tens of thousands, while Japanese forces staged an anti-Japanese riot in 1932, resulting in the Japanese military razing the city, permanently occupying the neighborhood of Hongkew, and forcing the KMT military to leave the city.\n\nAfter the Japanese invasion, with pressure from the British, the KMT was forced to surrender the Chinese portions of Shanghai, while the French concession was also annexed into the International Settlement. While this expansion has granted us more resources to repair the city, it has also strained our budget, and greatly increased the tensions between our foreigner-led Council and the local Chinese population. If the Pearl of the Orient is to survive the decade, we must take decisive action, before the Japanese do it for us."

 XSI.FE_1.t:0 "Replacing Chén Jiè"
 XSI.FE_1.d:0 "Born in Hangzhou in 1885 to a well-off family, Chén Jiè studied in Japan after the Qing abolished the examination system, before transferring to the University of Berlin to study law in 1907, returning to China after the Xinhai Revolution. A lifelong bureaucrat, Chén Jiè had previously served in several directorial and administrative roles in the Bayang government while concurrently as a professor at Peking University. But since 1928, he has left government work and has worked mostly as the head manager of several banks, notably the Salt Industry Bank which was relocated to Shanghai in 1934. Having moved to Shanghai, he was appointed to the ratepayer council, having served as one of the main representatives for Chinese business on the council. However, the Kuomintang government reached out to Chén Jiè in 1935, seeking to appoint him as secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a result of his connections with Germany. In a meeting on December 23rd, Chén Jiè had submitted his resignation from the council, effective January 4th, and suggested that the Chinese members of the council should discuss a replacement to fill his vacancy.\n\nOn December 27th, members of the Chinese Ratepayers Association publicly ‘‘elected’’ Xi Yushu, a native of Shanghai and manager of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, but this election has been called into question. Because Chén Jiè did not finish his term, his replacement is supposed to be elected with majority approval from the council, not just the Chinese representatives. While this has occurred once before without issue, it is still against council rules, and several council members have questioned if filling the vacancy is necessary this close to the yearly elections making Xi’s reelection an inevitability, not to mention the possibility of this inspiring other council members to act with greater impunity (particularly the Japanese members). Despite this, Xi Yushu’s appointment by the majority of the council would be greatly appreciated by the Chinese members of the council, and the election of a local (even a bourgeois one) would help with convincing the local population of our legitimacy."
